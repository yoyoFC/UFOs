# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage with dynamic filters to display data related to the UFO sigh;tings.
The criterias to filter the data are related to: Date, City, State, Country and Shape of the UFO.  
During the construction of this webpage, different files were created to configure the visualization environment. The result is a combination of css, js and html filtes. 

## Results

User instruction for the UFO's website:

1. Open the webpage: This version of the website is deployed by openning the index.html file in any browser. (i.e.: Chrome)


2. Default view: When the page is opened the first the time, all the data will be displayed by default.



3. Filters - Date selection: The filters are located on the lower left corner. The first filter available is the "Enter Date". The format for this filter is D/M/YYYY. 



4. Filters - Multiple selection: Additional filters for City, State, Country and Shape are available on the lower left corner. 
You can write the filter criteria and press enter or click other field, the table search logic will refresh the table view automatically.

## Summary

- One of the drawback for the new website version is the automatic refresh after insert a filter. Personally, I prefer have a button to execute the refresh manually because if there is an typo error in one of the filter, the entire result of the table could be affected. 

- Export results: Sharing information is one of the main goals of this kind of websites. As additional tool to create a user friendly environment, I would recommend add an export logic/tool to download the filtered selection in a csv or excel file. 

- Special filter under the Comment column: Besides the main filters on the lower left corner, it would be beneficial if we add a global search for the "Comments" columns. It will bring more flexibility for the visitors to look for key words.
